        Devise allows users to select images from a media manager and manipulate them. To do this
        Devise needs ImageMagick (preferred) or GD installed. You don't need both - just one or the
        other. Getting either library installed can be a little tricky depending on the version of
        PHP you're running and environment but we have provided a few tips to the right.

        Mac OS (using

      <p>On the command line run the following command</p>
      <pre class="lang-bash" data-start="1">
                <code>
                  brew install imagemagick
                </code>
              </pre>
      <p>Or</p>
      <pre class="lang-bash" data-start="1">

        This is very much dependent on what you are using for development but any help you can
        provide others is greatly appreciated. Please submit any ideas for this section through a
        pull request.
